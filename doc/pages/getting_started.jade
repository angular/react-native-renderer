        # Getting started

        Creating an application with Angular and React Native means creating an actual React Native project, in which an Angular application runs.

        As a consequence, all the Angular features are available to you: http, router, directives, dependency injection, etc.
        And, at the same time, all the React Native tools and features are also available.

        The only exception are the high-level React components (View, Picker, Text, Image, etc),
        but they all exist as ambient Angular components that can be used in applications.

        ## Setup
        Please check the React Native documentation for:
        - [iOS requirements](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#requirements)
        - [Getting started on Linux](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started-linux.html#content)
        - [Android setup](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html#content)
        - [Linux and Windows support](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linux-windows-support.html#content)

        ## First application
        For a quick start, clone the [seed application](https://github.com/mlaval/angular-react-native-seed) and follow the instructions in the README.

        The steps are:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/mlaval/angular-react-native-seed.git
        cd angular-react-native-seed
        npm install -g gulp react-native-cli typings
        npm install
        gulp init
            gulp start.ios
            (OR)
            gulp start.android
        ```

        ## Going further
        Most guides from the [React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) are applicable.
        They are a valuable source of information, expecially when it comes to performance, debugging, etc.
